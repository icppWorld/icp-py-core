  - Updated certificate verification to handle sharded structure: `[canister_ranges, subnet_id, shard_label]`
  - Improved `lookup_tree` and `list_paths` methods for shard navigation
  - Updated test certificates to use v4 API format

- **Enhanced Certificate Verification** 🔒
  - Improved certificate delegation path handling

  - Node key caching for performance optimization

### Changed

- **Error Handling Improvements** 🛠️
  - All `Client` methods now raise `TransportError` for network issues
  - All `Agent` methods raise structured errors (`ReplicaReject`, `SecurityError`, etc.)
  - Certificate verification raises `SecurityError` subclasses
  - Better error chaining with `__cause__` attribute preservation
  - Improved error messages with sanitized stack traces

- **API Endpoint Updates** 🌐
  - Restored `check_delegation` logic for proper delegation verification
  - Updated to use v3 endpoint for call operations (`/api/v3/canister/.../call`)
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

- **Code Quality Improvements** ✨
  - Fixed circular import issues in `icp_core.__init__.py` using `__getattr__` lazy loading
  - Improved error chain setup for `TransportError` and `PayloadEncodingError`
  - Enhanced type annotations throughout codebase
  - Better code organization and maintainability

### Fixed

- **Circular Import Issues** 🐛
  - Fixed circular imports in `icp_core.__init__.py` using lazy loading pattern
  - Improved import structure to prevent import-time circular dependencies
  - Fixed mock import paths in tests

- **Error Chain Setup** 🔗
  - Fixed `__cause__` attribute setting for `TransportError` and `PayloadEncodingError`
  - Proper exception chaining for better debugging and error context

- **Subnet ID Extraction** 🔍
  - Improved subnet_id extraction from delegation with proper None checking

### Migration Notes

- **Error Handling**: If you catch generic `Exception`, consider catching specific error types (`TransportError`, `ReplicaReject`, `SecurityError`) for better error handling
- **HTTP/2**: No code changes required - HTTP/2 is automatically enabled for async methods
- **Certificate Verification**: Query signature verification is temporarily disabled in v2.2.0
- **Imports**: Error classes are now available from `icp_core`: `from icp_core import TransportError, ReplicaReject, SecurityError`

## [2.0.0] - 2025-12-01

### Breaking Changes

- **Certificate verification is now enabled by default for all query calls.**  
  - This improves security by ensuring responses are properly certified.  
  - If you need the previous behavior (verification disabled), you can do:
  
    ```python
    client = IcpClient(..., verify_certification=False)
    ```

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed: Missing flag byte in Principal decoding.
- Fixed: Authenticated query calls failing under certain conditions.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed
- **secp256k1 identity documentation and tests**  
  - Corrected documentation to clarify that secp256k1 uses 64-byte raw signatures (r||s format) with canonical low-S, not DER format.  
  - Fixed test expectation for secp256k1 public key length (128 hex characters for x||y coordinates, no 0x04 prefix).

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-20

### Security
- **Certificate verification now enabled by default**  
  - `Agent.update_raw()` and `Agent.update_raw_async()` now default to `verify_certificate=True` for maximum security.  
  - Users can still disable verification with `verify_certificate=False` for compatibility or testing purposes.  
  - This change ensures the most secure option is used by default, protecting against unverified responses from boundary nodes.

### Added
- **Certificate verification**  
  - Introduced BLS12-381 certificate verification using the official [`blst`](https://github.com/supranational/blst) Python binding.  
  - New parameter `verify_certificate` in `Agent.update_raw` and `Agent.update_raw_async`.  
  - When `verify_certificate=True`, update calls are verified against the IC's certified responses.  
  - Includes full unit test coverage for verification scenarios.  
  - **Note:** In later versions, certificate verification is enabled by default for security.  

### Changed
- **Endpoint upgrade**  
  - Migrated `update_raw` calls from legacy `/api/v2/.../call` endpoint to new **BN v4 call endpoint** (`/api/v4/canister/.../call`).  
  - Migrated query calls to **BN v3 endpoint** (`/api/v3/canister/.../query`).  
  - Migrated read_state calls to **BN v3 endpoints** (`/api/v3/canister/.../read_state` and `/api/v3/subnet/.../read_state`).  
  - Implemented response adaptation and improved retry logic for more stable request handling.  
  - Enhanced the `poll` and `poll_and_wait` methods for correctness and resilience.  

- **Timeouts & error classification**  
  - Added configurable timeout handling in client calls.  
  - Improved error classification for common canister rejection codes, with more structured runtime exceptions.

### Security
- Addresses longstanding gaps in certificate validation:  
  - `update_raw` and `poll` now support certificate verification when enabled.  
  - Protects against unverified responses from boundary nodes.
